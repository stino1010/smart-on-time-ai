SmartOnTime AI
Final project for the Building AI course
Summary
SmartOnTime is an AI assistant that predicts when someone is likely to be late for school, work, or meetings. It learns from calendar data, travel time and habits, and sends notifications before it is too late.
Background
People are often late because of traffic, distractions (like gaming or social media), or bad time estimates. This creates stress and lost time.
The idea is to help users plan better and reduce lateness through smart reminders.
How is it used?
Users connect their calendar and allow travel-time access.
The app predicts if they are likely to be late and alerts them to leave earlier.
Data and AI methods
Calendar data
GPS/travel data
Machine learning prediction models
Challenges
Privacy concerns
Unexpected events cannot always be predicted
What next?
Add smartwatch support, company tools, and better behavior learning.
